As in the unconstrained case, convergence follows by a KL type of argument
appied to $F(x) := \inf_{D(x)} h(x, \cdot)$, which we assume is semialgebraic,
since
\begin{itemize}
	\item $F(x_k) - F(x_{k+1}) \geq \frac{\mu}{2} \norm{x_k - x_{k+1}}^2$,
		which is easy to check, and
	\item $\abs{\grad f}(x_k) \leq \beta \norm{x_k - x_{k+1}}$
\end{itemize}

To guarantee this, we impose an additional assumption. First, let us define
\[
	\bar{h}(x, y) := \begin{cases}
		h(x, y), & y \in D(x) \\
		+\infty, & \text{ otherwise}
	\end{cases}.
\]
We assume that $(v, 0) \in \regdiff \bar{h}(x, y), x \in X, y \in D(x)
\Rightarrow \norm{v} \leq K \norm{x - y}$, as long as $x, y$ vary over bounded
sets.
